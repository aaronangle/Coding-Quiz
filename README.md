# Coding-Quiz

###Welcome to the Coding-Quiz. This application will test some of your basic knowlege of of computer programming. The test is timed so the faster you finish the higher your score will be. This website includes a lot of JavaScript to transition through each question. The questions were stored in an array as objects and each time a user goes to a new question the next object in the array is selected and displayed to the user. Some of the challeneges I faced while creating this application was displaying the questions on the page and going from question to question. I created a for loop that looped through the current questions answers and rendered them to the page. Then I added an event listener to the entire list of questions and target the click event to know where the user clicked. If the user clicks on the correct answer a message is displayed and the next question is rendered. If the user clicks on the wrong answer a messages is displayed, time is taken off from the total, and the next question is rendered. Another difficulty I faced was creating the high score list. The high score list is saved to the local storage on the browser so even if the page is refreshed or closed the score list will still be there.
